## research
People form beliefs in a world where evidence is often indirect, ambiguous, or inaccessible. I’m interested in how we learn to leverage our social and informational environments to learn efficiently and form accurate beliefs. I study the cognitive building blocks that we use to learn from socially mediated information, and how they’re adaptive (or maladaptive) in modern, digital contexts.
